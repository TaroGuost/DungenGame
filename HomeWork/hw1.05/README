For this assignment, I used lncurses library. The key you use to move the player is exactly same with the key list on the assignment. For the Movement you can use y,k,u,l,n,j,b, and n to control it. For the rest you can use space. For the Monster List Your can use m to open and escape to close it and up arrow and down arrow to scoll the Monsters.*****ONE THING NEED TO REMIND THAT ON THE MONSTER LIST MY ESCAPE KEY ONLY WORK IF YOU PRESS THE KEY TWITCE BUT IT WORK FINE WITH OTHER KEY VALUE LIKE 'e' SO YOU CAN USE BOTH ESCAPE AND 'e' TO CLOSE THE MONSTER LIST.
